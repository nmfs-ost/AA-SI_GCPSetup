This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Workstation for use with the **AA-SI (Advanced Acoustics - Scientific Integration)** toolset.

---

## ‚ûä Setup Prerequisites

This setup assumes:

1. You maintain a NOAA Gmail account.
2. You are authorized to deploy GCP Workstations hosted by NMFS - Office of Science and Technology. If you do not have this set up navigate to : [https://github.com/enterprises/noaa-nmfs](https://github.com/enterprises/noaa-nmfs)

---

## ‚ûã GCP Workstation Configuration

### 1. Navigate to GCP Workstations Console

Open your browser and go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/workstations/overview](https://console.cloud.google.com/workstations/overview)

---

### 2. Create a Workstation

Use the interface to configure and deploy a new workstation:

### 3. Choose name, display name and jupyter Lab configuration

---

### 4. Launch the Workstation

Once your workstation is created, launch it:

---

### 5. Open the Terminal

Start a terminal session within your running GCP workstation:

![Open Terminal](assets/instruction_2.png)

---

## ‚ûå Environment Initialization

### 5. Run Initialization Script

This script will:

- Download and run the AA-SI setup script
- Assign execution permissions
- Activate the Python virtual environment
- Start GCP authentication

Paste the following into your terminal:

```bash
cd && \
sudo rm -f init.sh && \
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfs-ost/AA-SI_GPCSetup/main/init.sh && \
sudo chmod +x init.sh && \
./init.sh && \
cd ~ && \
source venv312/bin/activate && \
gcloud auth application-default login && \
gcloud config set account {{ACCOUNT}} && \
gcloud config set project ggn-nmfs-aa-dev-1
```

**Note:** Replace `{{ACCOUNT}}` with your NOAA Google account email.

### 6. Reactivate the Environment Later

You can return to the AA-SI environment at any time by running:

```bash
source aa_si/bin/activate
```

### 7. Python Virtual Environments

The startup script automatically creates a Python 3.10 virtual environment named `aa_si`. However, you may want to create additional virtual environments for other Python versions or purposes.

For example, to create environments referencing the Python version, you can use commands like these:

```bash
# Create a Python 3.10 virtual environment named aa_si10
python3.10 -m venv aa_si10

# Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment named aa_si11
python3.11 -m venv aa_si11

# Create a Python 3.12 virtual environment named aa_si12
python3.12 -m venv aa_si12
```

To activate these environments:

```bash
# On Linux/macOS
source aa_si10/bin/activate
```

Feel free to use environment names and Python versions that fit your workflow. This allows you to work with multiple Python versions or separate dependencies as needed.

### 8. Start GCP authentication
Follow browser prompts to authenticate via your NOAA credentials. A Link will be provided in the terminal and it will carry you throiugh a process of google email based authentication. THis is where your Noaa email account will be required.

## ‚ûç Using the AA-SI Toolset

### 1. View Available Tools

List available AA-SI commands and modules with:

```bash
aa-help
```

---

### 2. Example Command: Download & Plot Raw File

```bash
aa-raw --file_name "2107RL_CW-D20210813-T220732.raw" --file_type "raw" --ship_name "Reuben_Lasker" --survey_name "RL2107" --echosounder "EK80" --data_source "NCEI" | aa-plot
```
