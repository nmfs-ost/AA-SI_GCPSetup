## ‚ûä Setup Prerequisites

This setup assumes:

1. You maintain a NOAA Gmail account.
2. You are authorized to deploy GCP Workstations hosted by NMFS - Office of Science and Technology. If you do not have this set up navigate to : [https://github.com/enterprises/noaa-nmfs](https://github.com/enterprises/noaa-nmfs)

---

## ‚ûã GCP Workstation Configuration

### 1. Navigate to GCP Workstations Console

Open your browser and go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com/workstations/overview](https://console.cloud.google.com/workstations/overview)

---

### 2. Create a Workstation

Use the interface to configure and deploy a new workstation:

---

### 5. Open the Terminal

Start a terminal session within your running GCP workstation:

![Open Terminal](assets/instruction_2.png)

---

## ‚ûå Environment Initialization

### 5. Run Initialization Script

This script will:

- Download and run the AA-SI setup script
- Assign execution permissions
- Activate the Python virtual environment
- Start GCP authentication

Paste the following into your terminal:

```bash
cd && \
sudo rm -f init.sh && \
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nmfs-ost/AA-SI_GPCSetup/main/init.sh && \
sudo chmod +x init.sh && \
./init.sh && \
cd ~ && \
source venv312/bin/activate && \
gcloud auth application-default login && \
gcloud config set account {{ACCOUNT}} && \
gcloud config set project ggn-nmfs-aa-dev-1
```

**Note:** Replace `{{ACCOUNT}}` with your NOAA Google account email.

### 6. Reactivate the Environment Later

You can return to the AA-SI environment at any time by running:

```bash
source venv312/bin/activate
```

Understand that python312 is a the most optimized python version for our aa-si tool. 

### 7. Start GCP authentication
Follow browser prompts to authenticate via your NOAA credentials. A Link will be provided in the terminal and it will carry you throiugh a process of google email based authentication. THis is where your Noaa email account will be required. If your session times out restart it :

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login && \
gcloud config set account {{ACCOUNT}} && \
gcloud config set project ggn-nmfs-aa-dev-1
```

## ‚ûç Using the AA-SI Toolset

### 1. View Available Tools

To explore our suite of functionalities run
